4. The patient profile shows the graph of the data he has entered in the period of one month.

//patient Endpoints
router.attach("/patient/{id}", PatientResourceImpl.class);
router.attach("/patient/{id}/settings", PatientResourceImpl.class);
router.attach("/patient/{id}/addpatientrecord", PatientRecordsListImpl.class);
router.attach("/patient/{id}/allpatientrecords", PatientRecordsListImpl.class);
router.attach("/patient/{pid}/patientRecord/{rid}", PatientRecordResourceImpl.class);
